## In a nutshell
Tomato is an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) to replace old-school management system for non-corporate supermarkets.
As a lead UX Engineer, I managed a small team to ship a product in an agile environment. I defined the product's visual
elements, designed wireframes, contributed to front end development, and created design system and implementation
guidelines for developers to streamline processes.

## Redesign before official release
Following the milestone-based roadmap, Tomato went through a series of testing phases. We mainly had an alpha phase for the
existing customers, and then beta for customers who want to test it out. During these phases and testing MVP
(Minimum Viable Product), We've collected feedback from beta customers and redesigned the product.

Most users are *Generation X (1965-1980)* or *Baby-boomers (1948-1964)*. They are less familiar with interacting
with technologies, and often have vision disabilities. **Therefore, the product redesign focused on the following:**
  - High contrast ratios across UI elements
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color scales
  - Clear affordances to Call to Action (CTA)
  - Accommodate fast data entries and inquires
  - Familiar workflow but better UX than previous products for migrating customers.

## Design System
I've spent much time having meetings with developers and a director to troubleshoot and resolve issues with bugs,
visuals, and interactions. Therefore, I needed to create a scalable and maintainable design system to better communicate
with developers and directors and most importantly, resolve problems and ship features to the end-users quickly.

### Creating Guidelines
As a UX engineer, I was responsible for implementing HTML and CSS layouts and interactions with Javascript and JQuery.
When I created generic layouts for the developers to copy and paste, the developers struggled on implementing designs
that deviated from the original layout. Implementation guidelines reduced time spent on troubleshooting layouts and
components generally caused by mistakes and miscommunication.

### Choosing primary color scale
The primary color scale was inspired by the leaf color of tomato fruit. Green as a main color instead of red made more
sense because the color red could be interpreted as a negative meaning.

![Color Gamut](/tomato/color-gamut.webp)
Color gamut describes a range of colors within a spectrum of colors. In the case above, the sRGB and DCI-P3 represent
color spaces within human vision. sRGB is the most dominant color space out in the market for regular monitors, and DCI-P3
is becoming more prevalent. Compared to what humans can see, monitors can output very tiny amount of greens. Which is why
a lot of the times, greens on a color scale may look neon or blueish.

![Colors](/tomato/colors.webp)
I've experimented with many color appearance model such as RGB, HSL, HSV, [HSLuv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#HSLuv),
and [CIECAM02](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIECAM02). After referencing colors from various models,
I've chosen the colors carefully to create a scale that is perceptually uniform and looks more like green.

![Icons](/tomato/icons.webp)
Icons were created to assist users identify which elements are there for actions. These icons were primarily used in
conjunction with buttons because important CTAs needed clear affordances for actions that affect user's workflow.
