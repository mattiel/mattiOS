## In a nutshell
Dexis is an API powered design system for designers and developers. This project explores how APIs could change the
workflow of maintaining and updating design systems. Dexis creates a common language between designers and developers
and design changes can be made concurrently between the two. Products also benefit from this because fetching live data
from APIs and then applying directly to tokens and components doesn't require an app update. How can this workflow be
achieved with Dexis?

Currently under development.
