## In a nutshell
The concept revolves around **self-hosting** on a server a user wholly owns. It promotes the idea of **decentralization**
— personal data is not tied to a centralized server that external organizations own. Instead, all data storage happens
in a server owned by the user.

[//]: # (Bridge solves many problems users might face when browsing on the internet and sharing and storing data by)

[//]: # (**granting permits** to requesters which gives read-only access to sensitive data from a at-home server instead of storing)

[//]: # (it in their servers, protect and enhance web browsing experience for people on the Wi-Fi network by **blocking)

[//]: # (privacy-invasive elements** such as ads and trackers, and **securely store files** in a home server they own.)

The key features include:
- **Power over sharing personal data** by granting permission to requesters read-only access to sensitive data from at-home
servers which are revocable at any time.
- **Protect, anonymize, and enhance the web browsing experience** for people on the Wi-Fi network by blocking
privacy-invasive elements such as ads and trackers.
- **Securely store files** in full-featured network storage hosted by the file owners themselves.

## Problems
>Majority of Americans feel as if they have little control over data collected about them by companies and the government

[*Pew Research Center*](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/)

There aren't any systems set in place to help people feel secure about sharing their data — they can't exactly see
or take control of the data shared. People will choose to share and store personal data in servers they don't own
because they don't have any other choice but to store data in the company's servers in order to use their services.

Personal data holders collect and use users' data to provide services to them. However, since everything is stored in
servers which users don't normally have access to, it's hidden from them, and they can't transparently see what they do
with it. **It's uncertain how data is exactly handled:**
- Is it properly encrypted and securely stored?
- Can it be accessed by anyone else without the user's permission?
- What if they use the data without acknowledgement?

**Bridge**'s goal is to relieve many concerns about privacy by providing them:
- Sense of security that people feel when they share their data
- Complete ownership of their data
- Clear understanding of how companies use their data
- Staying anonymous and not be tracked

## Permits
>... I’ve never been hacked and had personal information leaked before, I [store my sensitive data in a physical form]
as a preventative measure to keep my data private.

People want to take care of their sensitive data and want to be in of control it. Most people hate giving out their
information because it can be stolen and abused.

In the real world, permit is given to someone as an authorization to do something under a some sort of agreement.
Private data is being shared constantly for service under agreement. People do want to share their data when it's
necessary and a lot of the times it is for the benefit of the sharer. However, it's important to have a system that
prevents certain user data from being exposed indefinitely.

The problem is that external organizations have access to personal information, and it's stored in a location where
the sharer don't have a control over. This makes them feel *unsafe* and *insecure*. What if requesters have to ask for
permits whenever they need to access data, and users can revoke permits whenever they feel like it?

### The handshake
The concept of permit is a way to give users the ability to share their data with complete understanding of how it
will be processed and used. Since it's also stored in Bridge, it ensures protection and control by providing
read-only APIs which are only accessible until the permit is valid.

*Permits are granted after a request → review → approval process.*

![Permit request iterations](/bridge/permit-iterations.webp)
*Multiple prototypes were tested and iterated for clarity and simplicity of handshake process.*

### Permit management
After giving permits to requesters, permits show exactly what data is being shared and how it's being used by the requesters.
If users don't want to share their data for whatever reason, they can revoke permits with an ease.

## Blockers
>I feel invaded. I'm constantly being tracked on the web. I don't want anyone to access my private data and also be monetized.

Blockers are content blockers at a router level which requires no additional setup for all users on the Wi-Fi network.
Blockers protect users from unwanted tracks, malicious websites and privacy-invasive elements while browsing on the
internet or using applications.

### Website block
Blocking a website before it's loaded on the end user's devices is a way to protect themselves from getting attacked from
malicious websites.

![Blockers blocked example](/bridge/blockers-website-blocked.webp)
*Example of malicious page being blocked by redirecting web page request to Bridge's sentinel page.*

### Removing unwanted elements
Ads and trackers make people feel insecure while browsing on the web because they are everywhere — blocking them
reduces visual cognitive load and helps users stay anonymous while browsing the web.

![Blockers ads removed example](/bridge/blockers-ads-removed.webp)
*Unwanted contents such as ads and trackers are removed.*

### Custom blockers
For people who want to use their own custom blockers, they can create patterns to block specific elements.

![Blockers](/bridge/blockers.webp)
*Customizable blockers with patterns make Wi-Fi level blocking even more powerful.*

## Privacy report
Through interviews and research, it was important to ensure that people feel secure about their privacy. In order to do
so, privacy reports exactly shows how Bridge is working behind the scenes to protect them.

## Widgets and files

*Widget based desktop experience organizes features in clear manner for management*
![Desktop Files](/bridge/desktop-files.webp)
*Self-hosted Network Attached Storage(NAS) allows users to completely own their files without storing in third-party servers*
![File Optimize](/bridge/desktop-optimize.webp)
*User-centric file management prevents overload of unnecessary data for longevity of the mounted storages (HDDs, SSDs, M2s)*

## Design system
Tiny design system was developed to keep designs scalable, manageable, and consistent across the whole project.
![Design System Hero](/bridge/ds-hero.webp)

### Spaces
Inspired by how [REM](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths) units work in CSS. Focusing on consistency
and pixel-perfect driven components that are divisible by 2 evenly to prevent half-pixel values which could break
certain designs on certain browsers and devices.
![Spatial System](/bridge/ds-spatial-system.webp)

### Accessible colors and dark mode
The designs embrace color mode preferences and are [WCAG 2.1 Compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for
accessibility as contrast ratios are important for clear communication of data permits and preventing user errors.

### Layouts and typography
Using spacial guidelines as a base, column based layouts were spaced out accordingly and a set of typographic rules
were created to harmoniously work with the other components.

## Next Steps
Currently, personal data is shared in exchange for the use of organization's services, and people are concerned because
these data is stored in centralized servers that the sharers don't have access to. To solve this, this project's concepts
were centered around the idea of a decentralization by self-hosting through at-home personal servers. In addition,
it protects everyone's anonymity and privacy on the web. While it is not a perfect solution because it requires
stable home internet connection and some sort of server management, it is a good starting point to explore what might be
required to build a better solution.

Today, blockchain technology is being explored and used mainly for crypto currencies. [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)
is speculated to be the next step in decentralization of servers and transparent exchange of data. The next step would
be to explore how Web3 technologies can change how the services are used.
