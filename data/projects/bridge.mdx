## In a nutshell
I've reimagined how people's private data are handled by the requesters such as companies and government agencies.
Bridge aims to solve many problems users might face when browsing on the internet and sharing and storing data.

![Peek](/bridge/sneak-peek.webp)
## Goals
There aren't any systems set in place to help users feel secure about sharing their data — it really comes down to if
the user is willing to share the data with a company because they don't have any other choice but to store
data in the company's servers in order to use their services.

**Bridge** aims to provide users the following:
- Sense of security that people feel when they share their data
- Complete ownership of their data
- Clear understanding of how companies use their data
- Staying anonymous and not be tracked

Bridge's concept revolves around the idea of *self-hosting*.
The server is *decentralized*; it's not tied to a remote server they don't own but rather to a local server.
Through self-hosting and being a network router, Bridge also monitors the traffic and helps users stay untracked.

## Permits
>... I’ve never been hacked and had personal information leaked before, I [store my sensitive data in a physical form]
as a preventative measure to keep my data private.

People want to take care of their sensitive data and want to be in of control it.
Most people hate giving out their information because it can be stolen and abused.
>What if requesters have to ask for permits whenever they need to access data, and users can revoke permits whenever they feel like it?

### Handling permissions
Users don't have to worry about how their data is stored and used by the requesters because it's end-to-end encrypted,
and APIs ensure decryption and storage of the data isn't possible without their knowledge.
It also provides transparent information about what's shared.

*Permits are granted after a request → review → approval process.*

### Permit management
After giving permits to requesters, permissions show exactly what data is being shared and how it's being used by the requesters.
If users don't want to share their data for whatever reason, they can revoke permits with an ease.

## Blockers
>I feel invaded. I'm constantly being tracked on the web. I don't want anyone to access my private data and also be monetized.

Blockers are content blockers at a router level which requires no additional setup for all users on the Wi-Fi network.
Blockers protect users from unwanted tracks, malicious websites and privacy-invasive elements while browsing on the internet or using applications.
