## In a nutshell
Bridge is a product ecosystem provided by a physical server/router device with a desktop web app and a mobile application.

The key features include:
- **Power over sharing personal data** by granting permission to requesters read-only access to sensitive data from
at-home servers, which are revocable at any time.
- **Protect, anonymize, and enhance the web browsing experience** for people on the Wi-Fi network by blocking
privacy-invasive elements such as ads and trackers.
- **Securely store files** in full-featured network storage hosted by the file owners themselves.

## We don't feel safe
>The majority of Americans feel as if they have little control over data collected about them by companies and the government

[*Pew Research Center*](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/)

There aren't any systems to help people feel secure about sharing their data — they can't exactly see or take control
of the transmitted data. People will choose to share and store personal data in servers they don't own because they
don't have any other choice but to store data in the company's servers to use their services.

Personal data holders collect and use users' data to provide services to them. However, since collections happen in
servers that users don't own or have access to, it's hidden from them, and they can't transparently see what they do
with it.
**It's uncertain how data is exactly handled:**
- Is it adequately encrypted and securely stored?
- Can it be accessed by anyone else without the user's permission?
- What if they use the data without acknowledgment?

## Decentralization by self-hosting
The concept revolves around **self-hosting** on a server a user owns. It promotes the idea of **decentralization** —
personal data is not tied to a centralized server that external organizations own. Instead, all data storage happens in
a server owned by the user.

**Bridge**'s goal is to relieve any concerns about privacy by providing them:
- Sense of security that people feel when they share their data
- Complete ownership of their data
- A clear understanding of how companies use their data
- Staying anonymous and not being tracked

## Permits
>... I've never been hacked and had personal information leaked before; I [store my sensitive data in a physical form]
as a preventative measure to keep my data private.

In the real world, permits are granted to someone as authorization to do something under some agreement. Private data is
being shared constantly for service under the contract. People do want to share their data when necessary, and often it
is for the benefit of the sharer. However, it's crucial to have a system that prevents specific user data exposure
indefinitely.

### The handshake
People want to take care of their sensitive data and want to control it. Most people hate giving out their information
because it can be stolen and abused.

The concept of permit is a way to give users the ability to share their data with a complete understanding of how it
will be processed and used. Storing data in Bridge ensures protection and control by providing read-only APIs, which are
only accessible until the permit is valid.

*Grants of permits happen after a request → review → approval process.*

![Permit request iterations](/bridge/permit-iterations.webp)
*Multiple prototypes were tested and iterated for clarity and simplicity of the handshake process.*

### Permit management
After giving permits to requesters, permits show exactly what data is being shared and how it's being used by the requesters.
If users don't want to share their data for whatever reason, they can revoke permits with an ease.

## Blockers
>I feel invaded. I'm constantly being tracked on the web. I don't want anyone to access my private data and also have it
monetized.

Blockers are content blockers at a router level, requiring no additional setup for all users on the Wi-Fi network.
Blockers protect users from unwanted tracks, malicious websites, and privacy-invasive elements while browsing on the
internet or using applications.

### Website block
Blocking a website before loading on the end user's devices is a way to protect themselves from getting attacked by
malicious websites.

![Blockers blocked example](/bridge/blockers-website-blocked.webp)
*An example of a malicious page being blocked by redirecting web page request to Bridge's sentinel page.*

### Removing unwanted elements
Ads and trackers make people feel insecure while browsing on the web because they are everywhere — blocking them
.

![Blockers ads removed example](/bridge/blockers-ads-removed.webp)
*Removal of unwanted contents such as ads and trackers reduces cognitive load and helps users stay anonymous while
browsing the web*

### Custom blockers
People who want to use their custom blockers can create patterns to block specific elements.

![Blockers](/bridge/blockers.webp)
*Customizable blockers with patterns make Wi-Fi level blocking even more powerful.*

## Privacy report
It was essential to ensure that people feel secure about their privacy through interviews and research.
Privacy reports show how Bridge is working behind the scenes to protect them.

## Widgets
Complex information is made into cards to organize and reduce the cognitive load by adding depth to each feature or
element.

![Desktop Main](/bridge/desktop-main.webp)
*Widget-based desktop experience organizes features and displays essential information on a single page.*

## Files
Files are stored as it would like any other cloud storage service. In addition, users are encouraged to organize and
optimize storage spaces as physical storage such as hard drives needs to be maintained by the owners.

![Desktop Files](/bridge/desktop-files.webp)
*Self-hosted Network Attached Storage(NAS) allows users to own their files without storing in third-party servers*

![Optimize Files](/bridge/desktop-optimize.webp)
*User-centric file management prevents overload of unnecessary data for the longevity of the mounted storage (HDDs, SSDs, M2s)*

## Design system
Crafting a tiny design system helped keep designs scalable, manageable, and consistent across the project.

![Design System Hero](/bridge/ds-hero.webp)

### Spaces
Inspired by how [REM](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#absolute-lengths) units work in CSS, the spatial system
focuses on consistency and pixel-perfect driven components divisible by two evenly. It prevents half-pixel values,
breaking designs on specific browsers and devices.

![Spatial System](/bridge/ds-spatial-system.webp)

### Accessible colors and dark mode
The designs embrace color mode preferences and are [WCAG 2.1 Compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for
accessibility as contrast ratios are essential for clear communication of data permits and preventing user errors.

### Layouts, typography, and glyphs
Column-based layouts and typographic rules were created using the spatial system to work harmoniously with the other
components.

### Components

## Lessons learned
In an attempt to solve privacy concerns people face when using services or browsing the internet, this project's
concepts were centered around the idea of decentralization by self-hosting. **This may not be a perfect solution because it requires:**
- Stable home internet connection for server uptime.
- Some server management and storage management.

Building a product ecosystem and systems to alleviate privacy concerns is a complex task. Permits gave me an opportunity
to learn and explore how private data must be exchanged. **Users want clarity and ease of exchange of data, while
maintaining privacy.** As we've always exchanged with simple agreements, people will always have preference and have
expectations simplicity of agreement while being secure or else the solutions will never work.

### Web 3
Today, blockchain technology is being explored and used mainly for cryptocurrencies. [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)
is speculated to be the next step in the decentralization of servers and transparent exchange of data. Blockchain eliminates
the need for third party servers, and creates direct connections between users and the providers.

This allows the control and management of private data much simpler and more secure because third parties cannot access
the data unless the sharer gives them permission. **How might this change the product ecosystem of Bridge?
Will users ever need a private server at-home then?**
