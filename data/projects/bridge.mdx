## Sneak Peek
I've reimagined how people's private data are handled by the requesters such as companies and government agencies.
Bridge aims to solve many problems users might face when browsing on the internet and sharing and storing data.

Personal data holders collect and use users' data to provide services to them. However, since everything is stored in servers which
users don't normally have access to, it's hidden from them, and they can't transparently see what they do with it.
- Is it securely encrypted?
- Can it be accessed by anyone else without the user's permission?
-

There aren't any systems set in place to help users feel secure about sharing their data â€” it really comes down to if
the user is willing to share the data with a trustworthy company because they don't have any other choice but to store
data in the company's servers.
