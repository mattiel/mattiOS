## In a nutshell
As a product designer, I focused on working collaborative with clients and stakeholders by identifying business goals and
user needs to ideate, design, and develop Stay: a web-based mobile application. The preset-focused design approach
reduces steep learning curve and helps guests to "just set and rest". The mobile app was developed with Vue, and
contributed to component development. Biggest accomplishment of this project is working on energy-saving
feature, resulting in a $100k average in annual saving for the hotel.

Currently, the company has pivoted and rolled out a tablet-based app, empowering over 250+ hotels in South Korea.
